## This project consists of reuseable components across other projects

### There are no dependencies apart from create-react-app framework and node-sass

### Works with React version 16.8 and above

Components are highly tested are as follows

Form Component capable of importing Input components with its' managed state.
Input components are as follows
  - (Default) Input
  - EmailInput
  - PhoneInput
  - UrlInput

There currently is no npm package for this, as there is more advanced version for React Form component, but that's not the main reason. NPM ecosystem with built and encrypted packages are a potential security flaw for apps, thus I highly will not publish this library to NPM. It's safer for everyone to just use this project by simply importing it.
